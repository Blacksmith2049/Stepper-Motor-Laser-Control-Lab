#If you happen to run into a permission error (as I did), you can delete the "Externally Managed" file from the directory
#The simplest fix to the pip "externally-managed" error is to navigate to /usr/lib/python3.xx and delete the EXTERNALLY-MANAGED file in the directory. Here are the commands to do so:
  #cd /usr/lib/python3.11
  #sudo rm EXTERNALLY-MANAGED
#If you choose to restore this mechanism, create the same file again with the touch command:
  #sudo touch EXTERNALLY-MANAGED
